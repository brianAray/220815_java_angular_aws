# How To Use This Repository

Included within this repository are all notes, guides, and exercises for the 10 week Java/Angular Enterprise curriculum. Use this repository as a reference for your self learning, and add to it on your local computer while you go through training.

The weeks will gradually, throughout training, be filled so the folders remain here for organization.
