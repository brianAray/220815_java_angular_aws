	 * Abstraction
	 * 
	 * Simply put, abstraction is anything but displaying only the essential
	 * features of a system to a user without getting into its details.
	 * 
	 * For example, a car and its functions are described by the buyer and
	 * the driver also learns how to drive using a steering wheel and the 
	 * pedals, but they do not need to understand the engine or the mechanics
	 * of the car itself to actually use it.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * In abstraction, there are two types:
	 * 
	 * - Data Abstraction
	 * 		In short means creating complex data types but giving out only the
	 * 		essential operation
	 * 
	 * - Control Abstraction
	 * 		Referring to software that is part of abstraction, the program is
	 * 		simplified and unnecessary execution details are removed
	 */
	
	/*
	 * Main points
	 * 
	 * - Control abstraction follows the basic rule of DRY (Do not repeat yourself)
	 *   and using functions in a program is the best example of control abstraction
	 * - CA can be used to build new functionalities and combine control statements
	 *   into a single unit
	 * - Fundamental to higher level languages, not just Java
	 * - Higher-order functions, closures, lambdas are preconditions for control abstraction  
	 * -

	/*
	 * Data Abstraction
	 * 
	 * Only the essential details are displayed to the user
	 * We have the car example, but another can be shown below
