# Branc Naming Strategies

Branch names can be anything you'd like, however, it is more useful to your organization to have branch names that are descriptive at a glance. For example, naming the branch after the person responsible and the feature they are working on:

- username/description
- username/workitem

You can name a branch to indicate it's function, like a feature, bug fix, or hotfix:

- bugfix/description
- feature/feature-name
- hotfix/description
