        Scripting languages are typically snippets of code that automate some funcitonality. It is not a complete application or program

        So what is JavaScript?

        JavaScript is a combo of programming/scripting languages. It was originally designed to provide functionality for a web page. This
        would effectively make the page dynamic. 
        Clients were able to run code on their machine instead of always sending a request to another server and waiting for the response.

        JavaScript as a scirpting language, uses an interpreter as opposed to a compiled language like C++ or Java. 
        This means that it is read line by line, instead of being read all the way through and compiled into an executable binary format.

        The compiler helps in finding errors before the process is complete.

        What makes JS a little different is that some of it is compiled, and then it is read by an interpreter.

        Eventually, as the V8 engine (Googles interpreter for the browser) become more popular, it was converted into a C++ shell and thus
        Node.js was born.

        Features JS:

        - Object Oriented
        - Supports Functional Programming
        - Loosely Typed
            (A variable can hold any data type)
        - it's dynamic ( JS can be controlled during runtime easily)
            - You can modify the structure of objects while the program is running more than in non-dynamic languages
        - Originally JS was designed for DOM manipulation
