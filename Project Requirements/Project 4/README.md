## Notes

Use this project as an opportunity to use all the technologies you have learnt so far during training. Copying previous code or code that was written from another project will not help you better understand what you are doing. The goal for this project is a refresher and an opportunity to work on something you have not touched on yet.

If you have any questions, email or reach out to your trainer.
